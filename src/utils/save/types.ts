// ─── Save Strategy contract ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The game uses the browser's synchronous `localStorage` as the source of
// truth at runtime — ~15 module-level reads fire during app bootstrap and
// many components write back on change. Each environment (plain web,
// CrazyGames, Glitch) layers a different *backend* on top of that local
// mirror to persist progress between devices.
//
// Rather than scatter build-flag branches through every call site, each
// backend is implemented as a `SaveStrategy`. `SaveManager` picks one at
// boot, hydrates localStorage from the backend, then forwards every
// subsequent local write to the strategy. Adding a new backend is a matter
// of implementing this one interface.

/**
 * Narrow accessor passed to strategies so they can read / write
 * localStorage without re-entering the SaveManager's mirror wrappers.
 * Strategies MUST use this instead of `window.localStorage` during
 * hydration, otherwise they'd trigger their own mirror recursively.
